Register Number: 212225220104

Date of Submission: 25.08.2026

**Objective**
The objective of this experiment is to understand how to deploy and configure a database server in AWS. This lab focuses on launching an EC2 instance, installing a database management system (DBMS), configuring basic database settings, creating a sample database, and validating connectivity to the database server.

**Prerequisites**
Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
AWS account or AWS Academy Lab access
An existing VPC and EC2 knowledge (from previous labs)
Basic knowledge of Linux commands and SQL
Tools Used
AWS Management Console
Amazon EC2
Security Groups
SSH Client (Terminal / PuTTY)
MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL (any one)
**Tasks Performed**

Task 1: Launch EC2 Instance for Database Server
Launch a new EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2 AMI. Select an appropriate instance type and configure key pair and security group.

Task 2: Configure Security Group for Database Access
Modify the security group to allow:

SSH (Port 22) for remote access
Database port (e.g., MySQL – 3306 or PostgreSQL – 5432)
Task 3: Connect to EC2 Instance
Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH from your local machine.

Task 4: Install Database Server
Install a database server software such as MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL on the EC2 instance using package manager commands.

Task 5: Start and Configure Database Service
Start the database service and configure basic settings such as root password and user privileges.

Task 6: Create a Sample Database
Create a sample database and a table inside it. Insert a few records into the table.

Task 7: Test Database Connectivity
Test the database server by connecting to it locally or remotely and performing basic SQL queries.
**
Workflow (Student Explanation)**
First, a security group named DB Security Group was created to allow the web server to connect to the database using port 3306 (MySQL).
A DB Subnet Group was created with subnets from two Availability Zones to allow the database to run in a Multi-AZ environment for high availability.
A MySQL RDS instance named lab-db was created with the database name lab, username main, and password lab-password.
The database was associated with the DB Security Group and the Lab VPC so that the web server can securely connect to the database.
The web application running on the EC2 server was opened using its IP address, and the RDS endpoint, database name, username, and password were entered to interact with the database.
